### Coding Standards and Guidelines
##### Backend
1. When using functions please put the Curly bracket right after the functions.

eg.
    void testFunction (){
    }

2. All function names have a lowercase for the first word and an uppercase for each word after that.

eg.
    testFunction();
    helloWorld();

##### If you can find anything else add it I can help with .md syntax
